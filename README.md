Thoughts and pseudocode

Game Rules:
- The Game is played by two players

- Players take turns to mark 1 cell as their own
- A marked cell, can not be marked by the other player

What needs to be created?
- The gameboard with its 3x3 grid of cells
- A way to print the board onto the console
- A way for the players to take turns
- A way for the players to mark a cell
- A way to check if a player has won yet
